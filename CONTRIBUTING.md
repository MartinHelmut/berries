## Issues

### General

Issues have a specific pattern for the title:

```markdown
package-name: Here is the title
```

that could look like:

```markdown
acai-cli: Write documentation for tool
```

The description should be as clear as possible. Sub-tasks could also be added by a task list.

### Labels

* Common labels
* Type labels
* Status labels

## Working in the code

### Environment

Tested with Node 8 and NPM 5 and up. Also this repository is organised as a monorepo and uses [lerna][lnurl].

### Setup

Clone the repo and run an install:

```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:MartinHelmut/berries.git && cd berries && npm install && npx lerna bootstrap
```

### Run tests

To run all tests execute

```shell
$ npm test
```

and to lint the code:

```shell
$ npm run lint
```

You can also run a prettier verification for all JS files in all packages with:

```shell
$ npm run fmt:check
```

This will list changes that would be made on commit (commit hook is installed with husky).

### Show documentation

To create and serve the documentation run the following command **inside a specific package**:

```shell
$ npm run docs
```

### Commit changes

**This repo is is Commitizen-friendly!** ([read more][czcli])

Checkout a new branch, e.g.:

```shell
$ git checkout -b task/do-something
```

**There is no specific naming convention for branches.**

Add your changes and run `npm run commit` to start the commitizen cli to create a proper commit message.

Create a "Pull Request" on Github and be awesome! ðŸ˜Ž

### Recommended workflow for release

1. Make changes
2. Commit those changes with `npm run commit`
3. Make sure all tests turn green with `npm test`
4. Publish: `npm run publish`
5. **Done!**
